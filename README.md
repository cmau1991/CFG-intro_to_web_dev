What did I enjoy the most?
Thoroughly loved learning through playing around with the documentation offline between sessions
The training sessions were great fun and paced just right

Thanks for the opportunity and support


What didn't I enjoy?
Debugging! However, the sense of achievement and satisfaction when resolving a bug was worth the hard work and head scratching!
